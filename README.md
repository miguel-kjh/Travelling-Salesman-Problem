# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
The problem of the traveling salesman, problem of the traveling salesman, problem of the traveling agent or traveling salesman problem (TSP) answers the following question: given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of them, which is the shortest route possible that visits each city exactly once and at the end returns to the origin city?

The first approximation would be through approximate algorithms. The networkx library will be used to work with graphs.

Methods to solve it: 2-aproximate, Christofides (3/2-approximate), ants system and MIP with Gurobi. To optimize the results, local search has been used with the following methods: 2-opt, Simulated Annealing, Tabu search and Genetic Algorithms.
